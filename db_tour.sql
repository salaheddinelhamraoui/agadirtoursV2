(13, 'What Tourists Should Expect When travelling to Morocco During Ramadan', '24-04-2021', 'What does the month of Ramadan mean for those visiting? If you are visiting Morocco during Ramadan, you will experience distinctive aspects of the culture that are only apparent once a year. Muslims fast from all food and water from dawn until sunset.', 'images/ramadan-in-morocco.jpg', 'When it is time to break the fast you will hear the evening call to prayer, which is announced through a loudspeaker. After a long day fasting, the prayer excites many Muslims as they enjoy iftar (the breaking of the fast) with their family and friends.\r\n\r\nAfter iftar, you will witness rows upon rows of people praying at mosques for the evening prayer, followed by a special prayer that is only recited during Ramadan. Around 11 p.m. or midnight dinner is served.\r\n\r\nIf you are visiting during the spiritual month of Ramadan, it is impossible not to connect with the unique local foods and traditions.\r\n\r\nWhat changes during Ramadan?\r\nAs days become nights and nights become days, adjusting to the time and eating schedule might be challenging, so you may need a good measure of patience. \r\n\r\nEveryone stays up late, and the following day do not expect to find anything open before 10 a.m. as people will sleep in much later than usual.\r\n\r\nYou might come upon some shops and restaurants that are not open at all during the day. Also, the majority of businesses (banks, supermarkets, and more) will have different store hours, closing early so that the workers can make it home in time for iftar.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to keep in mind when visiting is that monuments, historical sites, museums, and other tourist attractions might adjust their hours and will most likely close early.\r\n\r\nAround 5:30-6:30 p.m. you will find a fast-paced crowd hurrying to prepare for iftar. Everything is quiet by 7:30 p.m. when family and friends are gathering to eat iftar. Then, at 9:30 p.m. restaurants, cafes, and local vendors in the medina (old walled city) begin to open again. Business booms as everyone takes a stroll through the medina to shop and to walk off all the food they ate during iftar.\r\nMost importantly, you should be aware of the time change. While Morocco adopts Daylight Saving Time in the spring, the country moves back to standard time just before Ramadan, so the time changes back to Greenwich Mean Time.\r\n\r\nIam not Muslim. Do I have to fast?”\r\nThe answer is no. There are a few restaurants and cafes that remain open during the day and expect to serve non-fasting tourists or foreign residents.\r\n\r\nIt is forbidden for Moroccans to eat and drink in public, unless they have special conditions where they do not need to fast, such as an illness or pregnancy. The rules do not apply to visitors or non-Muslims; however, everyone fasting will greatly appreciate it if you avoid eating in public.\r\n\r\nYou may consider eating inside a restaurant or wherever you are staying (hotel, airbnb, host family, etc).\r\n\r\nAny special experiences I should have during my Ramadan visit?”\r\nEveryone visiting Morocco during Ramadan should experience a traditional Moroccan iftar, which consists of spiced harira soup, Moroccan brochettes, hard-boiled eggs, dates, sweet pastries, batbout (bread), and fresh-squeezed juices.\r\n\r\nBeing invited to someone’s house for iftar is ideal, because you will experience a traditional iftar with family and friends celebrating an exciting holy month.\r\n\r\nDo not worry if you cannot attend iftar at someone’s house. Many restaurants and hotels offer traditional, authentic iftar meals, which will still make a wonderful experience.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening, make sure to stroll by a mosque and witness hundreds of Muslims worshipping together as it is truly a memorable experience. One mosque that you might want to visit is the largest mosque in Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque located in Casablanca.\r\n\r\nLastly, interact with Moroccans you encounter and ask them questions about Ramadan and learn what this holiday means to them.\r\n\r\nRamadan might present challenges to tourists visiting Morocco, but it is also an eye-opening cultural experience that you will not discover elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis feature is part of an exclusive series at Morocco World News for Ramadan.

The slave origins are reflected by their performance which includes the use of a metallic instrument called karkaba, which sounds like handcuffs, and a dance that resembles jumping as a way to obtain freedom.', 'images/gnawa-music-performance-us.jpg', ' The principal instrument in Gnawa music is the guembri.  Similar to the loutar and the ribab, it is a piece of wood covered by sheepskin, but with three strings made of camel intestines which produce a deep and heavy sound like a bass guitar.\r\n\r\nEssaouira is becoming internationally known for its Gnawa World Music Festival which is held annually in May.

Marrakesh is the second-largest city and administrative center in Morocco. The heart of the Marrakesh, Djemma El Fna Square, offers an exciting experience with its souks, gardens, palaces, snake charmers, outdoor food stalls and fabulous shopping for Moroccan goods.\r\n\r\n?Depart from your hotel. Your introduction to Marrakesh will begin in the Medina, the old quarter of the Marrakesh. From here we will explore this historically charming area on foot. In Djemma el Fna, you will visit the famous 12th-century Koutoubia Mosque and its influential minaret. \r\n\r\n?Your guide will help you navigate through the labyrinth-like streets and alleys of the Djemma. Enjoy the aromatic streets, taste the fresh-squeezed orange juice and venture into the souks (shops) specializing in Berber carpets, silver jewelry, artisan workshops, handmade shoes, tanneries, etc. \r\n\r\n?Marrakesh is a city of underground channels built by the architects from Cordoba, Spain to provide water for the town and Palmery. We will drive to the Lower Medina to explore more of Marrakesh’s secrets: El Mansour mosque, the sixteenth century Saadian Tombs with its stark towers, the ruined 16th century El Badhi palace, and the Mellah and the Jewish quarter.\r\n\r\n?Enjoy a three-course lunch consisting of fresh salad, tajine, and fruit at one of Marrakesh’s most delectable restaurants. After lunch, we will head north of the Mellah to visit the 19th century Bahia palace, originally built for Si Moussa, a former slave who became King Moulay Hassan’s chamberlain. The palace holds a courtyard and riads decorated with beautiful carved stucco and Arabic architecture. \r\n\r\n?Next, we will visit the contemporary Moroccan Art Museum or Tiskiwin, a private museum dedicated to popular arts & crafts, styled as a beautiful Spanish-Moroccan house, next door to Dar Si Said palace, a smaller version of the Bahia. \r\n\r\n?Now onward to the new city, we will navigate our way to French, Gueliz, and head to the Majorelle Gardens, a magical and lush small garden estate designed by Jacque Majorelle and maintained by Yves Saint Laurent. The Majorelle Garden is filled with colorful walkways, ponds, cactus, and plants as well as a beautiful shop with hand-made goods. On our return to your hotel, we will pass by the La Mammounia Hotel Garden (where Alfred Hitchcock wrote the famous film The Birds)\r\n\r\nDAY 2: MARRAKESH  – ESSAOUIRA\r\n\r\n?After breakfast, drive to Essaouira. Essaouria is a fun-filled and relaxing day trip from Marrakesh and is the city that hosts the Gnaoua Music Festival. After breakfast at your hotel, depart for Essaouira. The journey to this former Portuguese fishing village offers up only a few roadside towns and the occasional Berber village. In the ’60s and ’70s, Essaouira was a pitstop on the hippie trek from Marrakesh. Jimi Hendrix made the pilgrimage, as did BobMarley and Cat Stevens. Essaouira was the inspiration for Hendrix’s song “Castles Made of Sand”.\r\n\r\n?Visit this sea-side medieval town that boasts lovely white-washed and blue-shuttered houses, colonnades, thuya wood workshops, art galleries, and mouthwatering seafood. Once called Mogador by European sailors and traders, Essaouria is known for its annual Gnaoua Music Festival that attracts 300,000+ people in June. It also has an expansive beach for surfing called Plage de Safi.\r\n\r\n?Take a stroll along the town’s sunlit pedestrian main square, Place Prince Moulay el Hassan and the Skala du Port, the fishing harbor, offers breathtaking views of the Portuguese ramparts. Explore the ramparts and the spice and jewelry souks of the medina. The medina of Essaouira (formerly “Mogador”) is a UNESCO World Heritage-listed city, as an example of a late-18th-century fortified town. \r\n\r\n?Have lunch at the fish-grill cafes, with wooden tables and benches laid out overlooking the sea that was once- in the 19th century- the only Moroccan port south of Tangier.\r\n\r\n?After lunch visit Orson Welles’ Square and memorial, designed by Samir Mustapha, one of the town’s artists, which pays homage to Orson Welles filming of Othello in Essaouira.  Essaouira’s history is a reminder of the times when Spain, Portugal, and England fought to maintain control over its coasts. It has a typical Portuguese harbor that is a stunning example of Moorish and Portuguese architecture.\r\n\r\n?Return to your hotel, relax and then attend the Gnaoua Festival late into the night.  \r\n\r\nDAY 3: ESSAOUIRA \r\n\r\n?After breakfast explore Essaouira or take a swim on the beach. Referred to as the ‘windy city of Afrika’, the beaches of the 18th century French-influenced Essaouria, which are the most popular. The winds make it the ideal place to host windsurfing competitions and year-round, you can spot people practicing the sport.\r\n\r\n?Essaouria attracts diverse crowds because it offers a range of activities to do. Shop in the famous Thuya wood carving shops, take in the panoramic sights by Skala du Port, embrace the cafe scene, or visit the nearby islands. History and cultural lovers will also enjoy exploring the Mellah, where up to 9000 Jews lived between 1875-1900 exporting goods like salt and jewelry to London. You can also spend an afternoon climbing 15th-century ramparts that were once sea bastions and fortifications. During the 19th century, Essaouira was the only part of the port south of Tangier to trade with Europe.\r\n\r\n?This beachside resort also has a fishing fleet and market. Essaouria offers a good range of cafes and restaurants near the ramparts with views of the sea. For lunch the best place to eat is at one of the lines of grills down at the port, an Essaouria institution, offering the freshest of a variety of kinds of fishes.\r\n\r\n?Essaouira is also renowned for its kitesurfing and windsurfing, with the powerful trade wind blowing almost constantly onto the protected, almost waveless, bay. Several world-class clubs rent top-notch material on a weekly basis. Parasols tend to be used on the beach as a protection against the wind and the blowing sand. Camel excursions are available on the beach and into the desert band in the interior.\r\n\r\n?In the evening continue the second day of the evening festivities of the Gnaoua Festival. \r\n\r\nDAY 4: ESSAOUIRA \r\n\r\n?After breakfast, for a side-excursion within Essaouira, visit Ranch de Diabat, located in the small village Diabat. Ranch de Diabat arranges tours of high quality with camels or horses – and it can be for 2 hours or it can be for several days. Relax on the beach or enjoy one of the many water sports activities like kayaking, kite surfing, windsurfing, or just regular surfing.\r\n\r\n?Enjoy lunch in the old medina and relax at your hotel before attending the Gnaoua Festival.\r\n\r\nDAY 5:  ESSAOUIRA  \r\n\r\n?After breakfast, relax on the beach then prepare for a visit to the hammam. The Moroccan bathhouse (Arabic hamm?m) is the North African variant of a steam bath. Hammams have played an important role in cultures of the Middle-East and North Africa serving as places of social gathering, ritual cleansing and special customs attached to them. The majority of Moroccans visit a hammam at least once a week. The process involved in visiting a Hammam is similar to that of a sauna but is more closely related to the ancient Roman bathing practices.\r\n\r\n?Moroccans traditionally perform their own cleanses which involve locating a spot on the floor of a hot room (some people bring their own mats), filling a few buckets with water, and lying there until you sweat out all your impurities. This too is the same process that foreigners and tourists engage in when going to a hammam.\r\n\r\n?If massage is available at the hammam, be prepared to be well scrubbed (in a hot room) on both sides of your body with a rough flat glove called a kiss. If you find this a little invasive, then you can bring your own kids. Also, come prepared with your own soap, shampoo, pumice stone, towel, and bathing suit- all bathers must display modesty.\r\n\r\n?Enjoy a relaxing lunch near the beach then and in the afternoon enjoy one of the many art exhibits or events surrounding the Gnaoua Music Festival. In the evening continue watching the Festival performances.\r\n\r\nDAY 6:  ESSAOUIRA  \r\n\r\n?Eat breakfast, and then explore Essaouira at your leisure.\r\n\r\n?Head back to your hotel for an afternoon rest and then take on the last evening of the Festival.\r\n\r\nDAY 7: ESSAOUIRA – MARRAKESH  \r\n\r\n?Depart Morocco. Private transfer to Marrakesh airport.\r\n\r\nMORE ABOUT THE GNAOUA MUSIC FESTIVALThe festival recently honored the Gnaoua musicians with a new stage, which is dedicated to them at Bab Doukkala, allowing the ardent supporters of the Gnaoua rhythms to meet with the stars, from Hamid El Kasri to Abdelkébir Merchant. This stage was created for 100 % Gnaoua concerts, as well as the traditional lilas in the exceptional Gnaoua Zaouia (trance performances) every evening at midnight for the purists. World and jazz musicians perform on the new stage Bab Sebaa and The Moulay Hassan stage is kept for the famous groups of very diverse styles. On the smaller stages in the medina, the new generation of maâlems performs, and fans of electronic fusion and contemporary Moroccan music now have two new dedicated areas: the Pepsi stage and the Méditel stage. The Gnaoua Festival offers 10 concert sites from which everyone can choose according to their taste, 10 different but complementary programs forming the details of a unique puzzle, that of a pioneering and cosmopolitan festival. The quality is excellent as ever.  '),
(15, 'Ait Ben haddou', '24-04-2021', 'Travel with us To Ait Ben haddou Kasbah in Ouarzazate, Morocco  Recognized as a UNESCO site, the Ksar Aït Benhaddou in Ouarzazate is one of the most extraordinary Kasbahs in Morocco. This giant fortification, which is made up of six kasbahs and nearly fifty ksours (individual kasbahs), is a great example of pisé clay architecture. Ait Benhaddou Kasbah and the Ouarzazate region should be top on your Morocco Travel list.Visit Ait Ben Haddou Ksar on a Morocco Private Tour.', 'images/morocco-fes-ait-bnhdou.jpg', 'Aït Benhaddou sits amidst a valley near the foothills of the Atlas Mountains, just thirty-two miles from Ouarzazate, the Holywoodof Africa . Ouarzazate first came into the international spotlight with the Hollywood film Lawrence of Arabia; Aït Benhaddou made a feature appearance in this film. Orson Welles used it as a location for Sodome and Gomorrah; and for Jesus of Nazareth the whole lower part of the village was rebuilt. Since then many famous directors have followed in his footsteps to exploit the magnificent scenery of Ouarzazate.\r\n\r\nInternational blockbusters shot there in recent years include: the French version of Cleopatra, Bertolucci’s Sheltering Sky, Scorsese’s Kundun, Gillies MacKannon’s Hideous Kinky, Ridley Scott’s Gladiator, Black Hawke Down, Oliver Stone’s Alexander The Great, Ridley Scott’s Kingdom of Heaven, and Penelope Cruz’s Sahara.Historically, traders carrying spices, slaves, and gold on the Sahara Trade Route passed by Aït Benhaddou and its Ksours on their way to Timbuktu or the Western Sahara. Today, the usage of this old trade route is fading and as a result many Kasbahs along it have turned into relics.Alternately, Aït Benhaddou, has been well preserved and kept in supreme condition with the goal of bringing more tourists to the south to see magnificent structures like Aït Benhaddou.\r\n\r\n Morocco First Gate offers tours to Aït Benhaddou, the Dades Valley, the Gorge of Todra and other magnificient vacation options when traveling to Morocco with us.The village of Aït Benhaddou sits on top of a hill and protects a series of Kasbahs and Ksour earth houses. Inside, the Aït Benhaddou village is decorated with a labyrinth like series of sandstone colored towers and walls. To one side of the village, a riverbed of the Mellah (old Jewish quarters) as well as several palm groves and trees can be spotted growing along the river bank. The village is particularly spectacular if you visit during the evening hours, at sunset, when the light and colors of remain transparent and glisten above Aït Benhaddou, making it glow.Aït Benhaddou village is divided in two parts.\r\n\r\nThe modern part is filled with tourist shops and parking spaces. Upon crossing the Oued (dry riverbed), you will enter into the Ksar, the real highlight.To prepare for the best photo opportunity, keep in mind that sunrise is the best time to discover the golden rays that jet across the Aït Benhaddou village. Afternoon or sunset shots can also be impressive, yet, they are more difficult to capture.The most popular things to photograph include the Kasbahs within the village, palm trees, decorative motifs, charming small streets filled with donkeys, or storks making a home on top of a mud house. To get an overall picture of Aït Benhaddou, you can climb to the top of one of the neighboring hills.In the Aït Benhaddou area, the only parts not well preserved are the badly damaged mud houses (ksours).\r\n\r\nAlthough most of them are now in ruins as a result of their former inhabitants moved closer to the modern road, the homes are interesting to explore because each one has a unique charm and tells its own story. There is currently a restoration program in place to keep these homes from further erosion; with a goal to eventually repopulate the village.');
